# A Description of the Northern Peoples

...and their circumstances and conditions, customs, religious and superstitous ways, skilld and sports, social structure and way of living, war, buildings and tools, mines and pits, wonderful items and almost all the animals who live in Scandinavia and their nature.

A work of varying content, packed with multifarious knowledge and foregin examples, with representations of indigenous items. The work is largely devoted to amuse and entertain, hopefully leaving the reader great pleasure.
